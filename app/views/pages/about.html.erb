How will NYMVIC help NY Muslims, our city and state? (Mission Statement):

NYMVIC will help qualified US citizens register to vote, and provide a forum for all members to learn about the issues and the news makers that most affect their communities in NY and beyond. By educating voters on the issues that affect NY, NYMVIC hopes to raise the level of political awareness, participation and civic engagement in the NY democratic political and election process.

What has NY Muslim political engagement in the past looked like?The NYC Council has had only one Muslim member elected in its history (Robert Jackson), and NY has never had a Muslim State Senator or Assembly member elected. While Muslims have established themselves alongside other communities and over generations in the professional, commercial, financial and social fiber and leadership in NY, they have yet to significantly effect and impact political decision-making. Their lack of political involvement and a voice had led to poor, misinformed, and inaccurate representations of Muslims by elected officials, and many in political and municipal administrations, but most strikingly when Muslims needed their representatives to stand up for their basic constitutional liberties, civil rights and American ideals.How will NYMVIC address the misrepresentation of NY Muslims?The inaccurate portrayal of Muslims has too often led to anti-Muslim public sentiment. NY elected officials, groups and individuals have unilaterally represented the positions of NY Muslims without objectively surveying their opinions or perceptions on issues that directly impact them, hence, creating erroneous impressions against Muslims for public and media exploitation. NYMVIC will periodically and scientifically survey members on current events, via questionnaire, to help ensure that NY Muslim opinion and sentiment is accurately represented in the public sphere.How can I help?Simple… JOIN… and get your interested friends to join... the more, the better.
